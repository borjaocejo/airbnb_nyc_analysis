# AirBnB EDA and Analysis
### EDA with Open NYC Airbnb Dataset
This project was made as a demonstration of the steps involved in exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## The Data
The data was gathered from a Kaggle dataset and is called AirBnB NYC Open Data. You can go to the original Kaggle submission [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data)

## Files
The following are the descriptions of the files in this repository.
1. AirBnB Project.ipynb - Jupyter notebook with full code (EDA and further analysis)
2. plot_helpers.py - helper functions I made for plotting maps using folium
3. AB_NYC_2019.csv - NYC listings data from 2019, sourced from Kaggle above

## Requirements
To run this notebook and helper function script, the following libraries are needed.
1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. matplotlib
4. seaborn
5. folium
